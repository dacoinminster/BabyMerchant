/************************************************************************
* @Function    : numberScaleNameShortScale()
* @Purpose     : Construct full name of the Short Scale Numeral System
*                Using the Conway-Guy system for forming number prefixes
*
* @Version     : 0.02
* @Author      : Mohsen Alyafei
* @Date        : 12 Jun 2020
* @Param       : {number} [Power=0] the power numeral of the base 1000
*                e.g. 1 means 1000^1 = 1,000
*                e.g. 2 means 1000^2 = 1,000,000 (million)
*                e.g. 3 means 1000^3 = 1,000,000,000 (billion)
*
* @Returns     : {string} The name of the large number
* @Example     :
* numberScaleNameShortScale(4);
* // => trillion
*
* numberScaleNameShortScale(21);
* // => vigintillion
*
* @Description : Handles power from 0 to 999
*                The larget scale name is therefor the umber with
*                3,000 zeros (Novenonagintanongentillion)
* @Reference   : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers
*
* For powers n from 1 to 10, prefixes are constructed based on
* standard dictionary entry.
* For larger powers of n (between 11 and 999), prefixes are constructed
* based on the system described by John Horton Conway and Richard K. Guy.
